| Published in?                | Science Advances; under the name: "Biomimetic composites with enhanced toughening using silk-inspired triblock proteins and aligned nanocellulose reinforcements" (09/13/19) |
| General topic?               | The creation of a new bio-based material made of "spider silk" and wood fibers. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | 1) Breaking down the tree pulp into cellulose nanofibrils. 2) Implementing a specific, synthetic, DNA in a bacteria, allowing the production of spider silk proteins. 3) Putting the silk matrix inside the nanofibrils web. 4) Aligning the nanofibrils, containing the silk, inside a rigid scaffold. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The newly created materials is very firm, resilient and biodegradable. The procedure could be used to manufacture similar composites but with different properties. |
| Remaining questions?         | / |
