| Published in?                |  ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces ; under the name: "Mussel-Inspired Injectable Hydrogel Adhesive Formed under Mild Conditions Features Near-Native Tissue Properties" (11/25/19) |
| General topic?               | Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology have develloped a mussel-inspired adhesive that could be used to repair body tissue. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | They equipped a gelatin biopolymers with chemical units (similar to the sea silk proteins found in mussel). |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | When the newly created gel comes in contact with a tissue, the structure of the protein cross-link with each other and establish a connection with the wound surfaces. Furthermore, this nature-inspired adhesive is capable of withstanding a pressure similar to human blood pressure.|
