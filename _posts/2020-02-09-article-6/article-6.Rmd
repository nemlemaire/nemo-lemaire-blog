| Published in?                | Scientific Reports; under the name: "Depicting corrosion-born defects in pipelines with combined neutron/γ ray backscatter: a biometric approach" (01/07/20) |
| General topic?               | Scientists have discovered that a combination of neutron and gamma ray could be used to detect leaks inside pipelines in a similar manner to the echolocation used by bats. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | 1) The researchers tried to find out a way to detect corrosion in underground and isolated pipelines since the usual method of using electromagnetic or ultrasound aren't very practical for those. 2) They created a new technique, using the properties of both: neutron and gamma ray and their reflection. 3) Their new device produce a very thin beam of neutron and gamma ray and is capable of comparing the two electronic signals re-emitted by them.|
| Conclusions/discovery?       | This system allowed them to distinguish the thickness of steel and even worked with insulating materials (such as concrete and plastic), furthermore, any leaks inside the steel would result in a variation in the backscatter (making their localisation a lot faster). The new device could also be used for bridges.|
| Remaining questions?         | How can the speed of the system be improve. |
