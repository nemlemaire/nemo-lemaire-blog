# Date to date:

09/11/2019: I nearly finished rereading "Norse Mythology" from Neil Gaiman. As I remembered the books is really interesting, the writter took inspiration from two olds translations: "Prose Edda" and "Poetic Edda" (respectivly written in the  XIII century). The last chapter that I read was about Loki's children and how their presence at the end of everything will bring demise to the gods.
