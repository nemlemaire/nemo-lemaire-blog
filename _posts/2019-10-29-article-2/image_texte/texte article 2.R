Researchers have developed artificial 'chameleon **skin**' that changes colour when exposed to light and could be used in **applications** such as active camouflage and large-scale **dynamic displays**.

The material, developed by researchers from the University of Cambridge, is made of tiny particles of gold **coated** in a **polymer** shell, and then **squeezed** into **microdroplets** of water in oil. When exposed to heat or light, the particles stick together, changing the colour of the material. The results are reported in the journal Advanced Optical Materials.

In nature, animals such as chameleons and **cuttlefish** are able to change colour thanks to **chromatophores**: skin cells with contractile fibres that move **pigments** around. The pigments are spread out to show their colour, or squeezed together to make the cell clear.

The artificial chromatophores developed by the Cambridge researchers are built on the same principle, but instead of contractile fibres, their colour-changing abilities rely on light-powered nano-mechanisms, and the 'cells' are microscopic drops of water.

When the material is heated above 32C, the nanoparticles store large amounts of **elastic energy** in a fraction of a second, as the polymer coatings expel all the water and collapse. This has the effect of forcing the nanoparticles **to bind** together into tight **clusters**. When the material is cooled, the polymers take on water and expand, and the gold nanoparticles are strongly and quickly pushed apart, like a spring.

"**Loading** the nanoparticles into the microdroplets allows us to control the shape and size of the clusters, giving us dramatic colour changes," said Dr Andrew Salmon from Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, the study's co-first author.

The geometry of the nanoparticles when they bind into clusters determines which colour they appear as: when the nanoparticles are spread apart they are red and when they cluster together they are dark blue. However, the droplets of water also compress the particle clusters, causing them **to shadow** each other and make the clustered **state** nearly transparent.

At the moment, the material developed by the Cambridge researchers is in a single **layer**, so is only able to change to a single colour. However, different nanoparticle materials and shapes could be used in extra layers to make a fully dynamic material, like real chameleon skin.

The researchers also observed that the artificial cells can 'swim' in simple ways, similar to the algae Volvox. Shining a light on one **edge** of the droplets causes the surface **to peel** towards the light, pushing it forward. Under stronger **illumination**, high pressure bubbles briefly form to push the droplets along a surface.

"This work is a big advance in using **nanoscale** technology to do biomimicry," said co-author Sean Cormier. "We're now working to replicate this on **roll-to-roll films** so that we can make metres of colour changing sheets. Using structured light we also plan to use the light-triggered swimming to '**herd**' droplets. It will be really exciting to see what collective behaviours are generated."

The research was **funded** by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
