| Published in?                | Bioinspiration & Biomimetics; under the name:"Reversible adhesion to rough surfaces both in and out of water, inspired by the clingfish suction disc" (10/25/2019) |
| General topic?               | Creation of a suction cup inspired by the ventral adhesive disc of clingfish. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | 1) Collecting organisms (clingfish) in a Marine Reserve. 2) obersvation in laboratory. 3) Mimicking the attachment mechanism inside their prototypes by adding a soft layers - of microscopic pillars - and slits. 4) Testing the adhesive strenght on different surfaces with the Finite Element Analysis. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The device works on all kinds of surfaces (both in and out water). It can hold up to 350 times its weight and require very little force for the adhesion, allowing the suction cup to handle fragile object. The soft layers and the slits help clinging on uneven surfaces; even though the simplier design (without the pillars but with a thick layer of silicone) works better.|
