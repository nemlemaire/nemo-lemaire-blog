| Published in?                | Soft Robotics ; under the name: "Octopus Arm-Inspired Tapered Soft Actuators with Suckers for Improved Grasping." (02/25/20) |
| General topic?               | The creation of a soft robotic arm inspired by octopus tentacles. |
| Procedure/what was examined? | 1) Observation of the tapering angle of octopus tentacles. 2) Quantifying the perfect design for both grabbing and twisting objects for a soft robot. 3) Observation of the layout and structure of the suckers in order to make them part of the design. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The new robot is able to hold a wide variety of shape and textures. But can also, thanks to the vacuum, attach itself to an object, wrap around it, carry it, and release it; in fact the combination of bending and suction allow each sucker to perfom the task of multiple ones.|
